# Cold War
Cold War is a simple decision game about the cold war period created, in a school project with Arcade (a python library designed for creating video games). In the game, you play as a spy, so the first thing you must do is choose your side. Either to fight for USA (CIA) or USSR (KGB). After that, you'll get several missions to complete, with two options each, and depending on your choices the game will have different endings. Our main goal is to follow the historical facts and play with them, creating unexpected ends that may or may not have happened in real life.
